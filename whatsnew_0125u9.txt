Source Changes
--------------
SH2 core: [R. Belmont]
 * refactored to separate out things that aren't part of the 
    interpreter.
 * converted context struct to go through a pointer

Fixed nile pitch calculation. [h0pdmiYX0]

MIPS3 recompiler: [Aaron Giles]
 * don't generate compare interrupts unless the compare register was 
    written to; fixes hangs in blitz, calspeed, and others
 * stash jump target address before executing delay slot; also, don't
    update link register until delay slot has finished executing;
    fixes hang in gauntleg
 * marked IDT instructions for R4650 only
 * accounted for time taken in throwaway likely branch slots
 * fixed jalr to respect the correct link register
 * fixed c.eq, c.lt, c.le to fail if unordered
 * fixed swxc1, sdxc1 to use the correct source register 
    (fixes many Gauntlet problems)
 * fixed CCR31 display in debugger
 * fixed LWXC1/LDXC1; corrects gauntleg camera
    
ADded state saving for flower.c. [couriersud]

Corrected dip setting for Risky Challenge. [Brian Troha]

Changed how watchpoints work so that supporting them adds 0 overhead
unless some are actually live. [Aaron Giles]

Removed calls to memory_set_context() in favor of 
cpuintrf_push_context(). [Aaron Giles]

Renamed wilytowr.c to m63.c. Added Irem M63 PCB layout (based on 
Atomic Boy). [Tomasz Slanina, Stefan Lindberg]

Fixed 32031 so that it doesn't call the debugger if not enabled.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed assertion in astring.c when compiled against MSVC and the 
string is UTF-8. [Nathan Woods]

Night Striker update: [kanikani]
 - Added World version as new parent (nightstr)
 - Renamed already-supported US version to nghtstru
 - Added Japanese version (nghtstrj)
 - Removed unnecessary analog input remapping
 - Added analog stick adjusting port

Added diplocations to all games in taito_z.c. [kanikani]

Added pot wheel support to world rally 2. [Mirko Mattioli]

Split ADSP2100 execution loop between debug/non-debug. [Aaron Giles]

Improved behavior of PGM on big-endian. The ARM7 boots properly now 
but can't sync with the 68k for some reason. [R. Belmont]

Update S14001A core: improved filtering to be more accurate to the 
chip, changed internal audio renderer to produce 4 bit sound as the 
real chip does. Moved filter outside of the main rendering loop into 
the glue code. Note: with this update, you may hear a whining noise 
that was not previously present. This is accurate to the chip! The 
real chip would almost always have an analog filter placed on its 
output to suppress this whine. [Lord Nightmare]

Fixed some save state problems in the DCS driver. Still comes out 
garbled on a load, however. Extended memory.c to support up to 4096 
banks. [Aaron Giles]

Improvements to Cal Omega driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Unified MACHINE_RESET for systems 903/904/905.
 - Created a new handler to manage the first 4 bits of system 905's 
    PIA1 portB as input mux selector (905 is still not working)
 - Updated technical notes.

Fixed incorrect assumption in the x86/x64 implementation of HASHJMP 
that the base table for a mode will always be allocated when a fixed 
mode is first used. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed 64-bit writes in UML C back-end. [Aaron Giles]

Preliminary emulation of video hardware (simple blitter) in Strip 
Teaser. [Tomasz Slanina]

I80286: Fixed POP ES in protected mode. [Wilbert Pol]

tumbleb.c update: [stephh]
 - updated Dip Switches for 'wlstar' and 'wondl96'
 - added notes for these 2 games and updated some others
 - added port tags and updated memory definitions and read handlers

Updated cheat system [ShimaPong]
 - Roll back older periodic function
   Now standard/old format work in this function
   Otherwords, several operations which doesn't exist in older
   function and added recently are now disabled
 - Separated load_cheat_code() to 3 indipendent functions
   And added new cheat options, "Load New/Standard/Old Format Code"
   (Default : load all format codes)
     NOTE : delete all cheat options in the database before start
            or reload default options (Shift + Reload key)
            in cheat general menu
 - Added format strings structure to accept huge size strings
   in loading a database to prevent from breaking other strings
 - Changed Link in new format
   Label code is now "Link-Label" and sub-label is "Label-Sub-Link"
   "Standard-Link" is no longer label
 - Added choose_label_index() to manage label selection
 - Fixed build_label_index_table() to prevent from crashing
   And disabled to build label index table in case of
   standard/old format
 - Fixed memory free problem in case of standard/old code
 - Fixed several reported/found bugs

Cleaned up input handling in seta.c and bigevglf.c. [stephh]

Adds rom loading for the cadillacs & dinosaurs sets with PICs, and
for several similar punisher sets. No good dumps of the PICs exist, 
and this is mainly for reference so that we don't forget the graphic 
rom loading on them. They don't work. They're basically the same set 
from different PCBs, so one will probably be removed eventually.
[David Haywood]

Fixed memory leak in ledutil.c. [HeadKaze]
