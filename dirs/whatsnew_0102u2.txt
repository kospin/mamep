Source Changes
--------------
Some minor cleanups to the System 32 driver. Air Rescue and F1 Exhaust Note
now share common multi-PCB faking logic. [Anonymous]

Properly hooked up tape samples in Thief, NATO Defense, and Shark Attack now
that sample pausing is available. [Bart Tobalske]

Fixed several uninitialized variables, incorrect string compares, and
inconsistent variable declarations found by the VC compiler. [Oshah]

Fixed 16-bit i386 disassembly so it stays within the current segment.
[Nathan Woods]

Some minor Turbo Sub changes: [Philip Bennett]
 * Added some more notes.
 * Corrected some hardware functions in accordance with the schematics.

Tweaked the 68000 disassembler to display F-line traps in a more obvious
fashion. Also changed to decorate jump targets for relative branches.
[Alex Jackson]

Rewrote the Voodoo emulation code to be more accurate to the original.
 * Support for multiple simultaneous boards (hello Silent Scope)
 * Pixel-pipelined framebuffer accesses now work
 * Alpha buffer operations now supported
 * Triple buffering now supported
 * Proper memory allocation and handling based on configuration
 * Proper FIFO handling, including low/high water marks and stalling
 * Approximate timing calculations based on quoted fill rate specs
 * Detail textures implemented
 * All math is done in fixed point
 * Proper edges calculated for polygons (stars appear in Gradius 4 now)
 * Much easier to add specific rasterizers now
This is a work in progress; some stuff is not quite right yet. Voodoo 2
emulation is completely broken. [Aaron Giles]
