 - swapped berlwall and berlwalt sets as per SebV notes in the source code

Fixed compilation issue for MSVC when using the winalloc code. [Nathan Woods]

Replaced the 68705 MCU from the bootleg Knight Boy with simulation. Added 
Knight Boy to keep using the MCU code. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added redump of bad ROMs for Cruis'n World (rev L1.3). [Guru]

Changed some i386 disassembly parameters to be unsigned. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed output of mame.ini options that have spaces in them. [Nathan Woods]

[David Haywood, Tomasz Slanina]

Added very, very preliminary emulation of the Ricoh RF5C400. [Ville Linde]

Added new inline math functions to mamecore.h, along with mechanisms for the
OSD layer to override them with platform-specific variants: 
count_leading_zeros, count_leading_ones, and fixed_mul_shift. Updated the
TMS32031 core to make use of the first two. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the Windows blitters to use an array allocated by 
osd_alloc_executable() to prevent potential access violations on systems
