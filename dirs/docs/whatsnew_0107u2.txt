Source Changes
--------------
Massive cleanup/fixing of 16-bit Sega drivers: [AWJ]
 * many corrections to descriptive set names, adding revision letters,
    cabinet types, etc.
 * fixed many DIP switches and added PORT_DIPLOCATION support
 * adjusted min/max values for analog controls to improve response
 * fixed button ordering between System 16A/B
 * cleaned up a number of ROM names and fixed some incorrect guesses
 * some cleanup of turbo.c as well
 * fixed visible area in Hang-On hardware
 * actually disabling 8751 in games that have a fake replacement
 * hooked up 8255 PPI correctly now that it has mode 2 support
 * fixed behavior of NMI line in later sega sound boards
 * fixed addressing in the SegaPCM sound system

Some cleanups in the new UI/video code to make MESS happy.
[Nathan Woods]

Added macros to prevent use of strcasecmp and strncasecmp for
better cross-platform compatibility. [Nathan Woods]

Connected unimplemented opcode $01 on the 6809 core. [Antoine Mine]

Implemented CNT pin and some serial features of the 6526 CIA chip.
[Nathan Woods]

Mapped service button in slammast. [Canim]

Fixed bug in 8039 CPU handling of A11 latch. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote Zaxxon driver from the schematics. This is still a WIP (not
finished yet): [Aaron Giles]
 * correct clock speeds and video timing
 * complete memory maps
 * connected universal sound board to Ixion and Razmataz
 * simplified video code and merged common cases together
 * palette derived from resistor weights
 * background positioning still a little off

Added service_coin_lockout_w() to lockout service coins. [Aaron Giles]

Added MDRV_SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS() which lets you specify a pixel clock,
horizontal, and vertical video timing values in place of the usual
screen size, visible area, refresh rate, and VBLANK timing values.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug that prevented save/restore from working in the UI.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed mode selection logic so that refresh is weighted more strongly
when picking a mode. This allows you to specify -resolution 0x0@60 to
force MAME to pick a 60Hz screen refresh while allowing it to choose
the best resolution. [Aaron Giles]
