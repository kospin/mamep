Source Changes
--------------
Added a new device type for timers. Where applicable, added a parallel
set of timer functions that take a device_config instead of an
emu_timer. Added MDRV_TIMER_* macros to define the timers in the
machine driver. Implemented both periodic and scanline-based timer
variants. Modified Space Encounters and Centipede to make use of this 
feature. Going forward, this is the preferred way of creating periodic 
timers. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Renamed *_vbl_cb to *_vblank_callback. [Aaron Giles]

Magicfly updates: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Completed the component list & PCB layout.
 - Added technical references to register $63 (magicfly).
 - Switched crystal to new predefined format.

Funworld updates: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Added proper inputs to jolyc980.
 - Added temporary patch to allow bypass the "code" screen in jolyc980.
 - Updated technical notes.

Changed exidy440_sound_command back to "UINT8." Since it's used by 
both 8-bit and 16-bit systems, the automatic allocation is not worth 
it if you need an ugly UINT16 ** cast. Removed deprecat.h from some of 
the exidy files. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed Air Buster bootleg from reseting because of the watchdog.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

The on-screen "Reset by watchdog" message only appears in debug 
builds now. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed the top screen in the megatech games. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added internal artwork for Gorf. [Mr. Do!]

Fixed memory leak in clifront.c. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added a crosshair_set_screen() to allow drivers to control which 
screen(s) on which crosshairs are displayed. [Nathan Woods]

Made it a fatalerror to registr save state callbacks at the wrong time
if the current driver claims to support save states. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed chicken and egg problem with device_start callbacks: 
[Aaron Giles]
 
 - Added DEVINFO_INT_TOKEN_BYTES, which is queried before device
   startup. It should return the size of the structure that will
   be hung off of device->token. It must not return 0.

 - Changed the core device interface to allocate and zero a block
   of memory the size of DEVINFO_INT_TOKEN_BYTES before calling
   device_start. The pointer to this memory is already attached
   to device->token at the time device_start is called.

 - The primary motivation for this is to allow the device_start
   function to make internal calls and pass the device_config *
   around as if the object were fully constructed. Since the token
   is used to indicate whether or not a device is live, this makes
   the device "live" at the time device_start is called rather
   than after it completes.

Moved per-screen initialization into DEVICE_START and per-screen 
cleanup into DEVICE_STOP in the core video implementation. 
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed render_target_get_minimum_size() to return nominal values
if no screens are found. [Aaron Giles]

Alpha Denshi major update: [Nicola Salmoria]
 - Fixed Alpha 8201/830x MCU simulation.
   - all hacks from the equites driver removed
   - fixed equites restart position after going underground
   - fixed hvolume, splndrbt 2 players
   - removed hacks from exctsccr2
   - fixed CPU gameplay in shougi
 - added dump of Alpha 8201 MCU to games that use it 
   (the ROM isn't used yet, HMCS44 CPU core needs to be written first)
 - major cleanup of the mess in equites.c:
   - many thanks to Corrado Tomaselli for precious hardware info.
   - implemented bg perspective scrolling using PROMs
   - fixed sprite flip & disable
   - fixed bg color
   - converted bg to tilemaps
   - fixed fg banking
   - fixed screen flip
   - removed meaningless banking of player inputs
   - added UI adjuster for MSM5232 frequency
   - MSM5232 volume control
 - fixed MSM5232 noise LFSR formula (done by Jarek Burczynski; 
    thanks to Corrado Tomaselli for samples)
 - changed MSM5232 emulator to output channels separately
 - added output of SOLO channels to MSM5232 emulator.
 - fixed champbas inputs
 - merged talbot with champbas, some driver clenaup
 - fixed shougi inputs
 - switched exctsccb to use the correct gfx ROMs (matches screenshot 
    found in 01058 exctsccb: Exciting soccer bootleg should be placed 
    in champbas.c.)
 - fixed sprite bpp in exctscrr, removed the horrible hacks that were 
    used to fix colors and transparency.
 - fixed sound clipping in exctsccr
 - added percussions to the equites.c games using samples; sound board 
    emulation is still not complete. Cymbal hit and hi-hat are 
    missing; bassline is incorrect, and DAC output should be filtered

Fixed crash in spbactn. [Zsolt Vasvari]

In drawgfx, removed unneeded pen lookups. Did some code formatting 
clean-up. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed ninjakd2 PCM sample rate to match pcb measurement. 
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed chdman -extract to a physical drive on Windows. [Aaron Giles]

Added return value to video_screen_update_partial() indicating whether
or not the VIDEO_UPDATE was called as a result. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed typo in pitnrun frequency. [Corrado Tomaselli]

DIP switch improvements: [RansAckeR]
 1945kiii.c, 88games.c and 40love.c: Made use of PORT_DIPUNKNOWN_DIPLOC
 40love.c: Made use of PORT_INCLUDE
 8080bw.c: Added more dip locations; Made use of PORT_INCLUDE
 wilytowr.c: Added dip locations for atomboy/wilytowr; Fixed coin modes
 battlane.c, battlera.c, battlnts.c, bbusters.c: added dip locations
 battlnts.c: made use of PORT_INCLUDE; fixed unknown dip switch
 bbusters.c: added note regarding correct gun calibration
 bionicc.c: Added dip locations
 bladestl.c: Added dip locations, made use of PORT_INCLUDE
 blockade.c: made use of PORT_INCLUDE
 beezer.c: Added dip locations
 bfm_sc2.c: dip switch improvements, made use of PORT_INCLUDE

Conerted the MPU4 driver to use an HD6845, as the Hitachi part was on the
PCB, while also using it to generate the VBLANK, rather than hardcoding
a value. Added the pulldown resistor to the network, and added all the
conditional inputs. Please note that on the later Cabinet Types (Ready
Steady Go-1 onwards), the 10p slot is locked out (location of the true
register for this is unknown), but the input setting is correct - you
have to use Coin 2 or higher to get money in. [James Wallace]

Fixed "garbage" (newlines) in the debugger window when debugging the 
SH-4 CPU. [Oliver Stoenberg]



New games added or promoted from NOT_WORKING status

Gekisou [Nicola Salmoria]
Pot Game (italian) [Roberto Fresca]


New clones added
