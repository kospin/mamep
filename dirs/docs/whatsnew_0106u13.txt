Source Changes
--------------
Some more fixes for the DTD in the -listxml output. [Krick]

Added more previously dumped PLDs to a number of games. [MASH]

Fixed uninitialized variable in the debugger commenting code. Cleaned
up allocations. [Nathan Woods]

Improved multisession support with the new renderer. [Nathan Woods]

Hooked up color PROM for schaser and fixed DIP switches.
[Roberto Fresca]

Fixed bug that caused -prescale in Direct3D mode to fail in the last

Fixed bug that led to black crosshairs in lightgun games.
[Aaron Giles]

Reimplemented the sparkle circuit to bring back stars in Tempest.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed the background brightness in vector games by default. If you
want to see the overlays faintly on vector games, increase the
brightness a bit. [Aaron Giles]

More Crystal Castles tweaks: [Aaron Giles]
 * Connected EAROM correctly (passes POST now)
 * Added a guess for what the "POTATO" chip does. If you're a CC fan
    report to MAMETesters how MAME looks compared to the arcade when 
    the screen scrolls up inbetween level 4 and 5.

Rewrote Cloud 9 driver to mimic the Crystal Castles driver since it
is obviously an early version of the same hardware: [Aaron Giles]
 * Implemented video RAM banking correctly based on tracing out a
    Firebeast PCB, which appears to be identical
 * Traced out color mapping and implemented correctly
 * Reduced EAROM down to 4 bits
 * Fixed DIP switch definitions

Some minor modernization of the xxmissio driver. [Aaron Giles]
