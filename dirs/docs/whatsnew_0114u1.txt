Source Changes
--------------
Added actual emulation of the microcontroller used for the Namco 50xx
chip as found in Bosconian and Xevious. [Nicola Salmoria]

In the COp420 core, fixed the XABR opcode, added LBI skip for 
extended opcodes, and fixed the CPU name in save states. Added 
GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE flag to the Cidelsa games. Draco still has no 
sound though. [Curt Coder]

Fixed crash in playch10 driver when run standalone. [Curt Coder]

Added skeleton driver for Konami Viper system. [Ville Linde]

Added skeleton driver for Dreamcast-based systems.

Added very preliminary SH4 CPU core. [R. Belmont]

Added DIP locations to the mario, mrdo, sheriff, and spacefb drivers.
[Justin Szczap]

Added debug attribute to the XML output. [Firewave]

Got the Hang Pilot driver working. The analog controls are still 
missing, however, so it's still marked as non-working. [Ville Linde]

Fixed crash with multithreaded rendering and the graphics viewer.
[Couriersud]

Improved the NWK-TR driver to get Thrill Drive mostly working.
[Ville Linde]

Fixed bug that caused video glitches when frameskipping due to using
out of sync textures. [Nathan Woods]

Updated video timing in the Sega System 16, Hang On, Out Run, and
X-Board games according to measurements from the boards. [Aaron Giles]

Substantially changed the TMS340x0 interfaces to allow the CPU
emulator to directly manage the video screen. Glitches in several 
games are now fixed as a result (for example the flashing screens in 
NBA Jam are now gone at last). [Aaron Giles]

Fixed internal timer counting in the TMS32025 core. This makes the
music in Cool Pool and 9 Ball Shootout bearable. [Aaron Giles]
