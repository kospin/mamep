Source Changes
--------------
Fixed the dips for Apache 3 and Dark Mist. [Brian Troha]

Added built-in overlays for clowns and maze. [Mr. Do!]

Converted Final Romance 2 to be dual screen. [David Haywood]

Converted the VFD display in the BFM games to use a second screen
rather than hacking onto the main screen. [El Condor]

Fixed detection of left/right modifier keys when paused. Also added
support for recently added keys so they are detected by MAME when
paused. [Ben Rudiak-Gould]

Changed render_target_alloc() to take a bitmask of flags. In addition
to loading a single file, targets can also be marked "hidden", and
only non-artwork views can be made visible. [Aaron Giles]

Added new render target layer config flag to disable screen overlays.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed snapshot taking code to render the particular screen to a
temporary render target. This allows vector games to have snapshots
again. [Aaron Giles]

Normalized the naming of several functions in video.c, most 
importantly: [Aaron Giles]

   force_partial_update -> video_screen_update_partial
   configure_screen -> video_screen_configure
   set_visible_area -> video_screen_set_visarea

Added new functions that do accurate per-screen timing based on
video parameters: [Aaron Giles]

   video_screen_get_hpos
   video_screen_get_vpos
   video_screen_get_hblank
   video_screen_get_vblank
   video_screen_get_time_until_pos

Fixed bug that caused the VIDEO_EOF to be called repeatedly while in
the debugger. [Aaron Giles]

Split render.c into rendutil.c, rendlay.c, and render.c to keep the
code more organized. [Aaron Giles]

Abstracted the notion of outputs. A new module, output.c, now controls
all outputs. Each output is tagged with a name; some standardization
eventually needs to happen on these names, but at the moment it's
fully open. The OSD layer can register with output.c to be notified
when outputs change. From there, it is free to do what it wants. LEDs
have now been converted to outputs with the name "led0", "led1", etc.
[Aaron Giles]

Added support for notifying external clients of changes in output
states in the Windows OSD system. See windows/output.h for a list of
messages that external clients can register to receive. Removed the
built-in hacky LED support in the Windows OSD layer. Created a sample
application ledutil.exe which subscribes to the external events and
routes the "led0", "led1", and "led2" outputs to the keyboard LEDs
just like before. If you want to continue to have LED support, simply
copy ledutil.exe into your startup folder and let it run in the
background. [Aaron Giles]

Modified the Q*Bert driver to signal a "knocker0" output when the
knocker is triggered. [Aaron Giles]

Added new layout element component type "text", which lets you draw
text in the built-in MAME font onto an element in a layout. This
can be used for basic lamps and built-in layouts. See maxaflex.c for
an example. [Aaron Giles]

Added new layout element component type "led7seg", which constructs
a 7-segment LED in an element in a layout. This is commonly used for
external score and timer displays. See maxaflex.c for an example.
[Aaron Giles]

Added built-in layouts for Turbo, Subroc 3D, Buck Rogers, Atari
Football, Atari Baseball, and Super Speed Racer using the new 
primitives. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed overflow computation in the S2650 core. [Aaron Giles]

More Sega G-80 raster cleanup: [Aaron Giles]
 * consolidated the video hardware implementations
 * fixed cocktail mode video and controls in all games
 * fixed Monster Bash (2 board version) video
 * revived Sindbad Mystery and fixed sound chip frequencies
