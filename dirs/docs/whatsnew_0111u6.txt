Source Changes
--------------
Fixed the data fetch and scrolling calculation for almost all video 
modes in the Amiga driver. [Ernesto Corvi]

Emulated the trench circuit in Space Encounters. [Adam Bousley]

Added win_output_debug_string_utf8(); a UTF-8 wrapper for
OutputDebugString(). Changed code to use it. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed the disassembly, operation, and cycle timing of many Thumb 
instructions in the ARM7 core. [MooglyGuy]

Defined new osd core function osd_is_absolute_path(). Changed behavior
of core fileio so that absolute paths are identified and search paths
ignored in that case. [Nathan Woods]

Improved validity check for coinage order so that it prints out the
correct order if an error is detected. [Ernesto Corvi]

Fixed clocks and other details in Dream World based on new
measurements. [David Haywood, Guru]

Implemented video circuits in the Midway 8080 driver based on
schematics. Note that this affected the visible area, so overlays will
need to be adjusted. Standardized the visible area across all games.
Implemented Phantom II cloud generator. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Changed the contract of the tilemap_create() call so that it is
guaranteed to succeed or die trying. Cleaned up code paths that 
checked the result of this operation to be simpler as a result.
[Atari Ace, Aaron Giles]

Added preliminary support for the built-in effects DSP in the SCSP, 
which lots of games use for reverb, QSound, and other effects. 
[ElSemi]

Removed archaic i8080_EXACT flag from the 8085 core. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Updated Midway 8080 driver to use properly computed video timings and
scanline interrupts. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed assertion in MPU4 driver. Fixed the mechanical meter operation,
enabling coin entry in Connect 4. [James Wallace]

Added mappings for break and pause keys. [Dirk Best]

Incorporated changes to MESS CPU cores to fix asserts and improve
Z80GB emulation. [Nathan Woods, Wilbert Pol]

Correctly connected sound IRQ in GX400/Nemesis driver. [R. Belmont]

Rewrote the SN76477 emulator from scratch. The main difference between 
the old one and the new one is that it is based on measurements from a
real chip. Also the emulator is fully analog, meaning that 
timings/frequencies, etc. are based on voltage levels. This gives a 
much more true-to-life emulation where the weird behavior of the real 
chip comes emulated for free. The code itself is also a lot simpler 
and more understandable. [Zsolt Vasvari, Derrick Renaud]

Cleaned up stray variables from the crosshair drawing removal. Also
removed some orphaned function declarations. [Oliver Stoneberg]

Added the missing volume and frequency controls to the Berzerk driver
and s14001a core. Fixed the issue with random words being spoken 
instead of the proper ones. Word is now latched at the proper time.
[Lord Nightmare]

Implemented flickering of the strobe light in Space Encounters, to be
eventually connected with artwork. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Changed driver_add/find/remove functions to fatalerror if they cannot
find their targets. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for screenless drivers. [Aaron Giles, Nathan Woods]

Fixed a couple of errors introduced in the OKI6295 pin shuffling.
[David Haywood]

Cleaned up DIP switches and added documentation to the Outrun driver.
[Brian Troha]

Fixed sound clock frequency in the NMG5 driver. [Brian Troha]

Fixed sound clock frequency in Night Slasher. [Sonikos]

Updated Sega System 16/18 drivers to be mono, and swapped button 1/2
to match instruction card. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Moved some of the tool sources to a new subdirectory tools.
[Aaron Giles]

Tweaked the main makefile to better support parallel builds.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed line array from mame_bitmap. Converted dozens of drivers over
to using BITMAP_ADDR macros instead. [Aaron Giles]

Changed automatic crosshairs so they are not quite so automatic.
They now need to be explicitly specified by the driver in the input
ports. Also changed the PORT_CROSSHAIR macro to take a shorter form
of the axis name. Updated all lightgun drivers to have this macro in
its default state. [Aaron Giles]

Added sliders for debugging crosshair positioning (debug build only).
[Aaron Giles]

Changed xevious to use irq0_assert_line instead of irq0_pulse_line
to prevent it from dropping interrupts. [Aaron Giles]

Changed Gorf to use HOLD_LINE instead of PULSE_LINE for scanline
interrupts. The timing is still off, but the game runs now.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed time H/V position reporting during the first frame of execution
using the new video routines. [Aaron Giles]
