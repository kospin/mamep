Source Changes
--------------
Added a large number of previously-dumped PALs to various games
across the whole source base. [MASH]

Some graphics improvements to the Magic Fly driver. [Roberto Fresca]

Fixed the fire button INPUT_PORT of player2 in Lethal Enforcers.
[Cananas]

Changed the coordinates where for offscreen lightgun reloading, moving
it from the upper-left to the upper-right for better compatibility.
[Cananas]

Fixed interrupt clearing function in 6840 module. [El Condor]

Added multiple input controls in -listxml output for games with more 
than one type. Added pedal control type. Added more info on analog 
controls as defined in the driver: minimum, maximum, sensitivity, 
keydelta, and reverse. This required the 'control' attribute in the 
XML to be moved into an element. There can now be more than one
'control' element in the input secction. [uRebelScum]

Improved the description of screens in -listxml. Multiple screens
are now listed, each with their own attributes. Rotation is now fully
specified (rather than just vertical/horizontal). The width and 
height now describe the raw game screen before any rotation.
[Krick]

Fixed bug that caused the UI to be impacted by command-line 
brightness, contrast, gamma controls. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug that prevented the contrast from pushing vector games to
their maximum brightness. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote Crystal Castles driver from the schematics: [Aaron Giles]
 * corrected clock speeds and frame rates
 * reimplemented video system to use mixer PROM
 * now using sync PROM to generate interrupts at correct times
 * sync PROM is also used to determine proper visible area and
    VBLANK timings
 * implemented the VRAM write protection by using the WP PROM
 * hooked up second player trackball properly
 * fixed coin counters
 * now computing palette based on resistor weights
 * watchdog is now set for 8 VBLANKs to match the schematics
 * added save state support
 * mapped complete memory space according to schematics

Fixed bug in JED parsing code that would checksum fuses beyond the
number explicitly specified. Some programs write extra fuse data
beyond the end and this should not be part of the checksum. Also made
the checksum parsing more flexible to handle JED files with extra 0
digits in the file checksum. [Aaron Giles]

Removed xml2info utility. The -listinfo format was retired over 2 
years ago. It is time to move on. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the core makefile to put back specific rules for building
EXEs to promote more commonality with platforms that don't put an
extension on executable files. [Aaron Giles]

Added gapless variants to the dual and triple screen layouts.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed 1 pixel border now that the Direct3D code is properly setting
texture clamping. This should get rid of the gaps in the Darius
layout, which were caused by bilinear filtering the last pixel on the
screen with the black pixel border. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed -effect none to longer produce an error message. [Aaron Giles]

Removed the VIDEO_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO_* flags for drivers. These flags
were used inconsistently, and can be effectively computed if 
necessary from the screen width/height and orientation. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the on screen display so that pressing ENTER resets a value
to its default. [Aaron Giles]

Moved all options to a single central location in windows/config.c.
Cleaned up and reordered the options more logically. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote windows.txt to reflect all of the new options and to update
the behavior of existing options to match the current implementation.
