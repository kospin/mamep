Source Changes
--------------
Rewrote ACIA6850 implementation. [Curt Coder]

Did a complete overhaul of the Mad Alien driver. [Stefan Jokish]
 - merged memory maps and added mirror addresses
 - doubled sound chip frequency
 - implemented IRQ acknowledge for the sound CPU
 - added stub functions for missing discrete sounds
 - re-implemented tilemaps (now the tunnel walls scroll into view)
 - hooked up 6845 CRT controller
 - made several fixes related to color handling
 - cleaned up inputs and added dip switch locations
 - raised main CPU speed (guesswork)
 - added save state support

Repaired the IC24 timer behaviour to fix some of Deal 'Em's bugs, 
and also added inputs. [James Wallace]

Added save state support to skykid. [Mike Haaland]

Fixed tiny.mak based on new source reorg. [Tiago Pierezan Camargo]

Added support for CR-589 firmware to the System 573 driver. Made
substantial changes to the SCSI support, making it require fewer
hacks, and allowing one device to be derived from another. Also
added save state support. [smf]

Added SCI support to M6803/HD63701. [Curt Coder]

Fixed several misnamed sound samples interfaces. [Atari Ace]

Switched model1 lookup functions to be index based rather than
requiring a linear scan. [Atari Ace]

Added generic I2C bus memory support. Hooked up to the cubocd32
driver. [smf]

Cleaned up inline assembly support: [Aaron Giles]
 * moved all inlinable functions into new module eminline.h
 * defined a number of new inline functions, including:
    - 32x32 -> 64 bit multiply
    - fast approximate floating point reciprocal
 * removed old inline definitions from osinline.h, osd_cpu.h, etc.
 * eminline.h contains C implementations of everything
 * new module eigccx86.h contains GCC-compatible x86/64 versions
 * new module eigccppc.h contains GCC-compatible PowerPC versions
 * eminline.h automatically detects GCC environments and includes
    appropriate file
 * osinline.h now only used in non-GCC environments
 * updated osd/windows/osinline.h to contain MSVC-compatible versions

Added NORM implementation to the TMS32031 core. [Aaron Giles]

Created new rgbutil module which consists of inline functions for
common RGB manipulation. This module can be accelerated with SSE2 or
other SIMD operations. By default, only 64-bit Intel builds make use
of SSE, since it can be assumed on those platforms. Reimplemented the
namcos22 rasterizer in terms of these inline functions. Also updated
the gaelco3d rasterizer to use this module for faster bilinear
filtering. [Aaron Giles]

Made some progress on the Midway Zeus-based system. The 3d command
stream is now parsed and the format is partially understood, enough to
display some polygons but with incorrect textures in Mortal Kombat 4.
