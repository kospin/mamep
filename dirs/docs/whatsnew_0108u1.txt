Source Changes
--------------
Fixed some DIP switches in bigrun and wildplt, and changed UK region
to Europe in f1gpstar and f1gpstr2. [Sonikos]

TIA-MC1 improvements: [Eugene Sandulenko]
 - More documentation
 - fixed inputs
 - fixed video framerate and VSYNC delay
 - adjusted CPU freq according to documentation
 - removed hack with off-board video RAM
 - implemented sound
 - added NO_DUMP PROMs

Improved documentation in the asteroids and tempest drivers.
[Brian Troha]

Improved DIP switches and documentation in the Championship Bowling
driver. [Brian Troha]

Major cleanup/rewrite of the NES PPU rendering code. [Brad Oliver]

Fixed protection in the world version of Virtua Bowling. [Brian Troha]

Fixed collision detection in Halley's Comet '87. [Brian Troha]

Added missing DIP switch to Hangman driver. [Wolfi]

Added a callback to the 68000 emulator for the TAS instruction,
which allows different implementations based on external hardware.
[David Haywood]

Namco System 22 update: [R. Belmont]
 - Fixed ROM loading problems reported by Guru
 - Hooked up Prop Cycle fan and lamp to the new output system

Added new flag: VIDEO_ALWAYS_UPDATE, which causes the VIDEO_UPDATE
callback to be called even on skipped frames. This should be used
for games where the process of rendering has side effects such as
collision detection that need to always be present. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed the new scanline timing functions to compute things
correctly and without using unnecessary timers. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed inputs in the Sega G80 vector games which were broken in the
last release cycle. [Aaron Giles]

Began cleanup/rewrite of the Turbo driver: [Aaron Giles]
 - proper video timings
 - full memory map
 - cleanup/simplification of the video code with better documentation
 - some things are still broken, this is a WIP
