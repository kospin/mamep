Source Changes
--------------
Improved DIP switches in benberob. [Brian Troha]

Added support for real Bubble Bobble MCU. [Trinity, Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed track lookup implementation in Virtua Racing, bringing the
game much closer to playable. [Olivier Galibert]

Minor cleanup and speed hack removal in the konamigx.c [R. Belmont]

Improved magicfly driver. All graphics are properly decoded / banked 
now. [Roberto Fresca]

More improvements to the 6840 timer module. Updated the MPU4 driver
to the most recent implementation. Convert Cosmic Chasm over to
using the new system. [El Condor]

65816/377xx update: [R. Belmont]
 * Made block transfer instructions interruptable as they are on 
    both actual chips (previously a single opcode could eat >400,000 
    cycles with obvious consequences for interrupt timing)
 * M377xx block transfers move one less byte than the 65816, fixed

Adjusted the DAC sound level on the 2612 to something more 
reasonable. [David Haywood]

Taito JC update: [Ville Linde]
 * Some general improvements to the driver
 * Added some more opcodes to the TMS320C51 core

Improved the M2 driver so that the M2 kernel starts to boot, but it 
hangs quite soon due to some multiprocessor issues. [Ville Linde]

Updated several games' input ports to use IPT_BILL1 for bill 
acceptors. [ClawGrip]

Properly documented and connected the MCU code in the Namco System 1,
System 86, Baraduke, Pacland, and Sky Kid drivers. [Brian Troha]

Renamed "Native" views to "Pixel Aspect" views to avoid the confusion
that they are anything but artificial aspect ratios. [Aaron Giles]

Added beam width control to the UI sliders. [Aaron Giles]

More Zaxxon driver cleanups/fixes: [Aaron Giles]
 * fixed sound problems in Razmataz
 * corrected background and sprite positioning
 * fixed bugs introduced in sample handling
 * bootlegs and alternate versions work again
 * added state saving support to the Sega universal sound board

Added several common generic graphics layouts to vidhrdw/generic.c, 
for use by multiple drivers. [Aaron Giles]

Added new option -video none which can be used for CPU benchmarking
without the overhead of the video system. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed remaining crashes in GDI/ddraw mode when drawing vector games.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed the -artwork option to avoid confusion. If you want to run
without any artwork, use -view standard instead. [Aaron Giles]

Added options -screen, -aspect, -resolution, and -view which apply
to all windows. These values can be individually overridden for each
specific window by using the existing -screen<n>, -aspect<n>,
-resolution<n>, and -view<n> options. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug that caused the sound sampling code to not track changes in
the refresh rate. [Aaron Giles]

Began cleanup/rewrite of the Sega G-80 raster games. This is still
very much a WIP, so don't report any bugs: [Aaron Giles]
 * cleaned up input port handling similar to the G-80 vectors
 * proper clock and video speeds
 * reimplemented Space Odyssey background including collision detect
 * fully implemented Pig Newton background
 * connected 2-board Monster Bash more correctly

Added new macro PORT_SERVICE_DIPLOC for specifying a PORT_SERVICE
and a DIPLOCATION. [Aaron Giles]
