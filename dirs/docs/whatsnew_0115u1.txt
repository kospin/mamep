Source Changes
--------------
Added support for playback of "extended" INP files that are commonly
found on compete sites. [David Haywood]

Added lswx and stswx opcodes to the PowerPC core. [Ville Linde]

Changed DRIVER_INIT macro to prepend driver_init_* instead of simply
init_* to be consistent with the other initialization functions.
[Atari Ace]

Corrected the pulse shape of the timer output in the MPU4 driver,
and also correctly identified the AY sound chip as an AY8913.
[James Wallace]

Merged leprechn driver into the gameplan driver and added correct
video timings. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Cleaned up the dorachan driver. Replaced fake color map with actual
color PROM decoding. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Cleaned up the supertnk driver. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Move Atari vector PROMs into separate regions. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Added DIP switches for Excite League. [Barry Harris, Yasuhiro Ogawa]

Improved m92 sprite drawing. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Rewrote the magicfly driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Figured out how the protection works.
 - Removed the hacks/patchs that formerly allow boot the games.
 - Figured out how the buffered inputs works.
 - Demuxed all inputs for both games.
 - Unified the memory maps from both games.
 - Added NVRAM support to both games.
 - Mapped DIP switches.
 - Managed the planes to get the 3bpp GFX colors accurate.
 - Renamed the ROMs acording to pcb pictures and ROM contents.
 - Cleaned up and optimized the driver.

Fixed throttle range in gforce2. [David Haywood]

Moved Win32 UTF-8 wrappers into a new module (winutf8.c), and added 
some new wrappers that Oliver Stoeneberg created for MAME32.
[Nathan Woods]

Aleck64/N64 update: [Ryan Holtz]
 - RSP: some opcodes bugfixed plus should work on big-endian targets
 - Real PIF ROM dump now used and required
 - Various other fixes

Fixed eeprom handling in surfplnt. [couriersud]

Fixed carry flag calculation for SUB/SBC/CMP family instructions in
the ARM core. [R. Belmont, Ryan Holtz]

Improvements to the ARM7 core: [R. Belmont, Ryan Holtz]
 - fixed 32-bit unaligned reads to "scramble" properly
 - fixed carry flag calc for SUB/SBC/CMP family instructions
 - fixed multiply-and-accumulate instructions
 - added more instructions to the disassembler
 - fixed logical and arithmetic shifts
 - added more Thumb instructions
 - fixed relative loads and stores
 - fixed LSL/LSR with zero shift values
 - fixed the disassembly of CMN
 - verified behavior when ADD destination is the PC on real h/w

Rewrote the Space Firebird driver: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 - Added star field, matches with the screen shot perfectly
 - Video timings/memory map/interrupts from schematics
 - Added support for the color fade effect

Identified a couple of new opcodes in the Irem V30 CPU which improves
matchit2. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Significantly cleaned up the Spiders driver. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Changed memory system behavior so that masks can be specified 
independently of mirrors. By default if the mask is 0 and a mirror
is present, the mask is implicitly ~mirror, just as before. But if a
mask is specified, it is not limited to the non-mirrored bits. This
allows you to independently control the mapping versus what is 
returned to the read/write handler. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote Astrocade driver: [Aaron Giles]
 - fully implemented all function generator modes
 - implemented pattern board according to schematics, including timing
 - fixed interrupt handling
 - added crosshairs to SeaWolf II
 - added stereo sound and panning to SeaWolf II samples
 - rewrote Astrocade sound emulation according to patent
 - sound generation now uses proper LFSR for noise effects
 - added partial support for Ten Pin Deluxe, including sound board
    emulation and internal layout

Fixed sound in Inferno after all these years. Sadly, it required a
hack. [Aaron Giles]

Added correct video timings for the Williams games. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for misaligned PIXBLT operations in the TMS34010 core.
The code still needs cleanup but improves the new JPM driver.
