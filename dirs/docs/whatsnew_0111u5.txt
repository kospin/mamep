Source Changes
--------------
Fixed a 6502 register naming bug, and fixed a size bug in the
SC61860 disassembler. [Nathan Woods]

Added built-in overlay layout for Crash. [Mr. Do]

Added save state support to Gyruss. [Buddabing]

Fixed missing sound interfaces from the MESS sound core merge.
[Nathan Woods]

Fixed several duplicated global variable names, removed unreferenced
items from header files, and added header files for several drivers.
[Atari Ace]

Changed debug console code to use auto_malloc and to detect attempts
at registering callbacks after initialization time. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed kof2003 bootleg code to work on big-endian systems. [R. Belmont]

Centralized some common Windows utility routines in new module
winutil.c. [Nathan Woods]

Cleaned up a few drivers to use input_port_dword_*_r. [smf]

Cleaned up memory maps in the MPU4 and BFM drivers. Redesigned the 
MPU4 code so that the DRIVER_INIT only needs to take an address in 
the ROM for the lookup table for CHR generation to be done.
[James Wallace]

Updated built-in expat code to version 2.0. [Atari Ace]

Fixed sound samples in Indian Battle. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added state saving to mhavoc. Also fixed sparkling vectors so 
slowdowns and vector list overflows can be expected. It looks much 
nicer, though. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Removed XORs from almost all CPS2 games in place of proper emulation
of the encryption. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added an assertion to prevent usage of pia_set_input_[a|b]() when 
input reading callbacks are specified. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed flip screen switch and changed COIN3 to SERVICE1 in the contra.c
driver. [Canim]

Cleand up and fixed DIP switches and inputs for the nmg5 driver.
[stephh]

Rewrote Z80 interrupt handling to avoid a bad bug in the post-EI
interrupt signalling. [Aaron Giles]

Added documentation to the esd16, afega, cave, unico, vamphalf, and
yunsun16 drivers. [Brian Troha]

Changed behavior in chdman so that a 0 sector size means the default.
[Aaron Giles]

Updated several video drivers (amiga, n64, ppu2c0x, psx, stvvdp2,
tia, v9938) to use the new BITMAP_ADDR* macros instead of using the
line[] array. [Nathan Woods]

Some additional Midway 8080 B&W driver fixes: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 - added PORT_CONDITION where needed
 - added PORT_CONFNAME entries to the 3 baseball games and Space 
    Invaders
 - save state support for all games
 - fixed typo and a bug with the Sea Wolf lamps

Fixed a minor problem with sound clipping in the s14001a.
[Lord Nightmare]

Fixed PRNG noise in the TMS5110/5220 code and added signal wrapping
to match the patent. [Lord Nightmare]

Cleaned up usage of auto_bitmap_alloc() now that it is guaranteed not
to fail. [Aaron Giles, Atari Ace]

Added sound effects emulation to the Berzerk driver. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed font aspect ratio on non-1:1 resolutions. [Aaron Giles]

Added mechanism to cache a binary format of BDF fonts for improved
loading speed. Also added a bit of progress when loading huge BDF
fonts so that you know what's happening. [Aaron Giles]

Removed gross TMS9928a configuration in place of more standard
techniques. Updates the Cliffhanger and sg1000a drivers accordingly.
[Aaron Giles]

Added support for the custom Badlands commands to the LD-V1000
emulation. [Aaron Giles]
