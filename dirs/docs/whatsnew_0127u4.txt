Source Changes
--------------
Added redump of indytemc. There's sprite/playfield flipping issues, 
hence GAME_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS. [Dazzer]

Improvements to Funworld driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Added new clone: Pool 10 (italian, set 4).
 - Improved lamps layout for all games.
 - Added Pool 10 pinout and DIP switches info.
 - Updated technical notes.

Continued I/O map merging. [Andrew Gardner]

Changed Namco NB-x to use real C75 BIOS, read controls the real 
hardware way. [R. Belmont]

Added lamps support + layout to magjoker and galaxi. Magjoker has a 
good lamps sequence in the attract. [Roberto Fresca]

Fixed crash when hitting watchpoints on static handlers. [Aaron Giles]

Changed Namco NA-2 to use real C70 BIOS. Removed sound and input 
simulation code. Changed the NA-1/2 MCU type to M37702. [Phil Bennett]

Added correct colour PROMS to arkatour. [Dazzer]

Fixed inputs in Main Event (SNK) based on the info in 
http://otoya.sheep-cloud.net/dipsw/ma-mo/mainevent.html. [9IEM1smI0]

Jaleco 'Bomb's Away' Improvements [aDG4W+qp0]

Fixed refresh rate and interrupts in sg1000a driver, added 8255PPI and 
coin counter. [Curt Coder]

Changed requirements for laserdisc CHDs to require a new chunk of
metadata with pre-decoded frame information. Modified chdman to
automatically produce this for CHDs that are of the appropriate
parameters. To fix up existing CHDs, use chdman -fixavdata on the
CHD. [Aaron Giles]

Modified the laserdisc core to leverage the pre-decoded frame
metadata, which is now required. This improves seek times when
searching and allows the player-specific emulation access to the
VBI data as soon as it would really be available. Changed update
callback timing to fire just before the first line of VBI data
would be read; at that point, the frame selection is assumed to
be committed. [Aaron Giles]

Converted PR-8210 emulation over to using the actual MCU from the
laserdisc player. This MCU controls low-level functions such as
slider position and laser on/off, and receives decoded vertical
blanking data in order to make decisions. Removed old HLE behavior.
Note that the overlay text is displayed via the UI; this is
temporary and will be fixed shortly. [Aaron Giles]

Converted Simutrek-hacked laserdisc emulation to using the actual
MCU from the game, which in turn hands off commands to the PR-8210
MCU. This is still not 100% but is pretty close at this point and
achieves the correct behaviors in most cases. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed Cube Quest overlay scaling to cover the whole screen.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed laserdisc video parameters to position the screen area at
the bottom rather than the top, since this corresponds more closely
to standard line numbering. [Aaron Giles]

Extended the vbiparse code to support pack/unpack, and to more
fully document all the meanings of the VBI codes. [Aaron Giles]

Updated ldplayer to support slow/fast forward movement, frame/chapter
display, and separate controls for scanning/stepping. [Aaron Giles]

Added new built-in variable "frame" to the debugger. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed device-based ROM loading to support loading ROMs from the
game's ZIP as well. [Aaron Giles]

CPU-internal regions now have priority again. Fixed mario by installing
a handler in the SOUND_START function. [Aaron Giles]

Improved DIP switch handling and added DIP locations in epos.c. [Tafoid]

Added DIP locations to the dec0 driver. [Tafoid]

Separate NBA Jam TE from NBA Jam as they are not technically clones of
each other. [Atari Ace]

Verified cpu clocks and corrected/verified OKI M6295 frequencies and pin
for Shadow Force. [Corrado Tomaselli]
