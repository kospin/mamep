Added direct mode JVS command, used by the i/o for the later Naomi 
games [ElSemi, Angelo Salese]

hyprduel fix [Hau]

Force cpu resyncs main<->protection on pgm. [David Haywood]

trackfld cleanups: [Aaron Giles]
 - derived clocks where possible
 - complete memory maps from the schematics
 - hooked up proper sound command latching
 - reimplemented 6802-based ADPCM samples for the bootlegs
 - merged memory maps
 - extended NVRAM to the full RAM range (according to schematics)
 - created common include file and modified drivers to use it instead 
    of explicit externs

Removed msb/lsb handlers from taitosnd. Updated all drivers to
call the 8-bit versions directly from the address maps. [Aaron Giles]

Did bulk replace of AM_READ/WRITE(SMH_NOP) -> AM_READ/WRITENOP.
[Aaron Giles]

Reverted recent TMS32025 timing change which busted Cool Pool sound.
[Olivier Galibert]

exctsccr update: [Uki]
 - verified clock frequency (including 4KHz NMI)
 - position 6A is not populated in JAPAN ver.
 - sound tempo is wrong in all sets (with or without this change)
 - clock for AY-3-8910 is 14.31818M/8 except for main melody

taito_l input updates: [Fabio Priuli]
 * added plgirls cheat dip-switch [found by Gatinho]
 * added plgirls2 coin mode B

Fixed crshrace coinage dips. [stephh, Fabio Priuli]

Fixed mechattu coinage dips. [Fabio Priuli]

Redumped GFX ROM of kakumei2. [Uki]

Improved the Wave-DMA behaviour in Naomi, added PVR-DMA support. 
[Angel Salese]

Naomi video cleanups/reworking. [David Haywood]

DIPSW update [kanikani]

    gaiden.c, hornet.c, namcos1.c, namcos86.c, nwk-tr.c, skykid.c, 
    zr107.c

 * removed use of sprintf
 * added a note about service menu browsing when mahjong panel is ON

Konami inputs improvements: [Fabio Priuli]
 * Added source file konamipt.h to unify Konami inputs where possible 
    (e.g. most 80s-90s games were using basically the same coinage 
    settings and joystick inputs). 
 * While at it, verified all 0x00 coinage effects in drivers which now 
    use konamipt.h (fixing a few mistakes: hexion, mikie, crimfgtj...) 
 * Added finalizb service coin. Removed roadf coin4 & asterix coin3 
    (neither used by the games nor present in service mode). 
 * Fixed gberetb coin inputs (they were switched). 
 * Added port_condition to hcrash so that brake appears only when 
    present in the chosen cabinet.

    Banpresto ones using same coinage settings)

Fixed the priority system in the jalmah.c driver [Uki, Angelo Salese]

Simulate 'keyoff' in the SPU. The envelopes aren't actually emulated, 
but the sound is silenced after a key-off (by placing the sound in a 
'release' state)  This prevents audiable sound from looping forever.
[David Haywood]

Build the IDE features table only when there is a CHD available.
[Curt Coder]

Added device-based implementations of the eeprom and i2c deevices.
[Samuele Zannoli]

Added diplocations to finalizr.c, gradius3.c, pandoras.c, rollerg.c 
and ultraman.c based on Guru's notes (thanks to AJG, who fwded them 
to me). [Fabio Priuli]

Dumped 1 BPROM of suchipi [Uki]

Changed Z80 cycle table definitions to be per-device. Removed
old set_info constants for the tables; they are now set up via
the z80_set_cycle_tables function. [Aaron Giles]

m90: reduced volume for all games, removed wrong graphics flag and 
added no cocktail flag for risky challenge. [robiza]

Reduced volume for bombrman, added wrong graphics flag for quizf1.
[robiza]

Removed old hardcoded keyboard handling for Atari 8bit systems and 
used more reasonable key matrix scan. No regressions expected in MAME 
(tested maxaflex.c games). [Fabio Priuli]

Many Naomi tweaks and improvements, plus a number of new sets added
but with no credit specified. [David Haywood]

Corrected names for Champion Italian PK boards (thank f205v for 
spotting this). [Mirko Buffoni]

 * proper input hookup in dakkochn
 * cleaned up rendering code
 * fixed cocktail mode in pretty much all games

 * proper global muting (attract sound off works in older games)
 * yes, the Pitfall 2 title is missing; more work to be done

Put tables used for RGB utilities in a single object file rather 
than compiling them as statics in every object that uses them.
[Vas Crabb]

Added small workaround to get Thunder Hoop 2 past the "bad 
coprocessor" screen, but the game still has issues. [Peter Ferrie]
