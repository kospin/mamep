Source Changes
--------------
Improved the cidelsa driver: [Curt Coder]
 - rewrote the cdp1802 cpu emulation as a state machine
 - fixed Draco dips and inputs (what a strange game!)
 - added NVRAM to Destroyer/Draco (Altair has no battery on the PCB)
 - fixed some clocks

Fixed mapping of spaceship controls in spcenctr. [Canim]

Removed the inclusion of unnecessary header files across the project.
[Atari Ace]

Added discrete filters to the new Namco 54xx sound effects. Also
implemented filters for the 52xx sound effects in preparation for
future changes. [Derrick Renaud]

Added pause support to the output system: [Bob Seidel]
 - added "pause" message through the Output system to let clients 
    know when MAME is paused
 - the state of an item is now sent when the item is first created
 - updated ledutil to use the pause state

Added cocktail mode and DIP locations to the Millipede driver.
[Mike Haaland]

Many more CPS2 keys added. Removed all XORs and support for them from
MAME. [Nicola Salmoria, Andreas Naive]

Fixed regression in the ar_xeon driver sprites. [Ernesto Corvi]

Kaneko driver improvements:
 - bloodwar: [Gary Walkling, Sebastien Volpe]
    * protection data extracted, still needs to be verified
    * collision detection simulation thanks to tests on real board
 - bonkadv: [Guru, Sebastien Volpe]
    * protection data fully verified: corrects tilemap colors in levels 2 and 3
    * correct implementation of MCU command 43

Fixed behavior of MOVEC instruction on later 680x0 chips, and in the
disassembler. [Ernesto Corvi]

Properly idenitified sound ROMs for Altered Beast set 2. [Brian Troha]

Fixed bad bits in a couple of FD1094 keys. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug in debugger that caused incorrect end offsets to be 
computed on CPUs with an address shift. [Ville Linde]

Moved some additional pieces of core functionality in the the core
utility library. [Nathan Woods]

Added sound to porky. [Tomasz Slanina]

Changed font scaling again. Fonts 24 pixels tall and above are scaled
the old way. Fonts smaller than that are scaled via integral scale
factors and adjusted the new way. [Aaron Giles]

Added a small optimization to the FD1094 decoding step. [Aaron Giles]

Added several new modules to the utility library libutil. First is a
generic huffman encoding module. Second is a module that allows you to
read/write AVI files in a platform-independent way. And third is a
lossless A/V compression module. These three pieces together, plus
some changes in the CHD code, allow for the creation of CHDs with
compressed audio and video. [Aaron Giles]

Added two new commands to chdman: -createav converts an AVI file in
uncompressed YUY format or HuffYUV-compressed YUY format with "left"
prediction into a CHD. And -extractav converts a CHD containing
compressed audio & video into an uncompressed YUY format AVI file.
[Aaron Giles]

Finished hooking up laserdisc support to the new audio/video 
compression. Note that we still do not have canonical CHDs of
laserdisc data at the moment, but all the support is now present for
when they start to appear. [Aaron Giles]
