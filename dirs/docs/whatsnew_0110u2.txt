Source Changes
--------------
Fixed flags access in the i286 core. [Barry Rodewald]

Updated MC146818 module to use new core date/time routines.
[Nathan Woods]

Cleaned up disassemblers to remove stubs and ensure the disassemblers
are not referenced except in debug builds. [Nathan Woods]

Added support for using CHDs to decrypt CPS2 games. This code is
disabled for the moment, but will be enabled in the future. Only a 
handful of games have complete tables so far. These tables are huge 
(~4GB) and uncompressable until the encryption algorithm is 
understood. [David Haywood]

Fixed bug in the debugger that caused watchpoints to not be active
until the next context switch. [smf]

Cleaned up the input definitions for n-way joysticks so they are
more explicit. Added concept of a "16-way" joystick, which is a
joystick that doesn't prevent simultaneous opposing directions from
bring reported. [smf]

Major System 573 update: [smf]
 * fixed PSX SIO control register behavior
 * implemented several SCSI CD commands: START/STOP UNIT, PAUSE/
    RESUME, READ SUB-CHANNEL, READ TOC

Fixed upside down service mode in the commando.c driver. [Canim]

Added support for the Triple Hunt 8-track audio. [Derrick Renaud]

Galaxian/Scramble driver reorganization: [Atari Ace]
 * machine/scramble.c is broken up into two files, 
    machine/galaxian.c and machine/scramble.c
 * drivers/amidar.c, drivers/frogger.c, drivers/scobra.c get copies 
    of some of the data structures they shared from other drivers 
 * galaxian_base is made static and uses outside of the main driver
    were rewritten
 * cclimber_decode code from drivers/cclimber.c was separated into 
    its own machine/cclimber.c file to allow mshuttle to share it 
    without taking on other dependencies

Added missing x-flipping support in Major Havoc. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Made some improvements to trivia madness driver. There still is 
something wrong in the question roms banking. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

More updates to the ST-V driver: [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
 * vdp1: added shading for sprites (used by znpwfv, cotton, others)
 * vdp1: fixed sprite clipping (fixes incorrect sprites in znpwfv)
 * vdp1: fixed transparency on colour lookup table sprites (fixes bad
          sprites in znpwfv)
 * vdp2: fixed caching of RGB layer (fixes bad backgrounds on bosses 
          in rsgun)
 * vdp2: added additive blending for tilemaps and sprites (rsgun)
 * vdp2: added vertical line scroll and linezoom (fixes diehard logo)
 * stv:  improved speedups for diehard
 * stv:  fixed speedups for znpwfv
 * stv:  added preliminary save state support

Significant cleanup of chd.c: [Aaron Giles]
 * got rid of the horrible last_error concept; now all routines 
    return an error directly
 * fixed several issues in managing metadata 
 * changed compression and verification routines to be client-driven 
    rather than monolithic
 * changed internal codec usage to be more flexible
 * altered chdman and MAME to use the new interfaces
 * added new -createraw command for creating raw data CHDs

Fixed crash bug in romcmp when comparing ZIP files. [Aaron Giles]
