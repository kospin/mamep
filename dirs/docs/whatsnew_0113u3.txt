Source Changes
--------------
Added proper MC8123 decryption code. Hooked up a number of games that
were using the chip, making many of them playable. [Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed several SHARC opcodes where data transfer was done regardless 
of the condition. This fixes many things, like the upside-down 
geometry in Model 2B games. And also, probably all the remaining 
clipping issues in Gradius 4. At least the planet zooming out in the 
intro works now. [Ville Linde]

Added Z-clipping to the Model 2 driver. [Ville Linde]

Replaced old Sega System E driver with new one based on HazeMD.
[David Haywood]

Fixed a large pile of DIP switches in the Sega System E games.
[Brian Troha]

Fixed crashing bugs in SCSP emulation. [David Haywood]

ES5503 improvements: [R. Belmont]
 - Fixed extraneous click at end of samples
 - Improved timing behavior. Fixes music tempo in many Apple IIgs 
    apps and games in MESS.

Fixed display of immediate word and long operands in the TMS340x0
disassembler. [Philip Bennett]

Updated Ultra Tank to component value code instead of a generic 
emulation and added Sprint 4 audio. [Derrick Renaud]

Added save state support to the gaelco3d driver. Also added save 
state support to tms32031.c and dmadac.c. [couriersud]

"Fixed" analog controls in some vector games by adding back a faux
VBLANK timing. [Derrick Renaud]

Changed the TMS340x0 core to clear the HSTCTLH NMI bit on an 
acknowledge. [Philip Bennett]

Externalized CDP1869 color bit handling to a callback function for 
MESS. [Curt Coder]

Refactored the options code into a new generic utility module
options.c. Moved the MAME core options into a new module emuopts.c.
[Nathan Woods]

Some minor NeoGeo set updates. [Johnboy]

Updates to the cybertnk driver: [PS]
 - inter CPU communications
 - inputs (almost complete)
 - sound
 - program ROMs marked as bad dumps
 - unmapped reads

Updated some more drivers updated to the new video timing.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Did a ground-up rewrite of the VIC Dual driver. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added a preliminary MB86233 CPU core. Still needs to be hooked up to
the Sega Model 2 driver. [Ernesto Corvi]

Fixed an interrupt delay slot problem in the SHARC core. [Ville Linde]

Improved K001005 polygon rendering. [Ville Linde]

Introduced a video_screen_exists() call, to determine whether a given 
screen exists. Updated the debugger to use this so as not to crash
if no screens are present. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed glitches in neogeo driver introduced in last update.
[Aaron Giles]

Added extensive (but still WIP) FD1094 debugging tools for help in
brute force searching for keys. [Aaron Giles]
