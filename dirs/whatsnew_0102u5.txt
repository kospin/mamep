Source Changes
--------------
Fixed bug in discrete filtering code. [Frank Palazzolo]

Fixed speedup for znpwfv so that it boots once again. [Mariusz Wojcieszek]

Improvements to cuoreuno and elephfam: [Roberto Fresca]
 * Corrected videoram and colorram (now can see the nvram initialization).
 * Corrected the CPU frequency to 2 MHz.
Still not working...

Fixed Playchoice/VSNES drivers. [Rob Bohms]

Hooked up the same NES APU implementation in both MAME and MESS. Also
correctd the memory mapping of the APU in the Playchoice 10 driver. 
[R. Belmont]

Hooked up Psikyo 4 PCM banking. [Anonymous]

Significant improvements to the Grand Champion driver: [Hans Andersson]
 * Tunnel headlights
 * Corrected rain effect
 * Corrected colors
 * Added speech
 * Improved collision detection (removed false collision when lightning)
 * Improved fog effect
 * Added skeleton code for motor noise
 * Fixed graphic glitch in bottom row
 * Corrected CPU speed for Cpu board / Game board

Added simulated version of the N64 PIF boot rom to the Aleck64 driver, so 
the cartridges now boot properly, though the cartridge CRC check fails on 
both games. [Ville Linde]

Fixed instruction alignment in the old debugger. Also added support for
64-bit qword display. [AWJ]

Fixed timing between CPU and MCU in chaknpop. In previous driver, you will 
notice problems in stages with water and coffee break (not always). New 
driver fixes it but it is not perfect about timing. [BUT]

Added sound to Honey Doll. [David Haywood]

Changed activecpu_dasm() and activecpu_dasm_new() so that they "function" 
even if the getinfo handler does not specify CPUINFO_PTR_DISASSEMBLE nor 
CPUINFO_PTR_DISASSEMBLE_NEW. [Nathan Woods]

Completed the X-Multiply DIP switches. [Roberto Fresca]

Moved m6809, hd6309 and z80 disassemblers to the new interface, and did 
some cleanups. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed the SUBW H flag in the SPC700 core. [Rob Bohms]

Added missing functionality needed to get rsgun working. [Olivier Galibert]

SP0250 update: [Nicola Salmoria]
 * Added SP0250 speech chip to 3 Stooges.
 * Streamlined the SP0250 emulation to avoid timing issues which were 
    preventing 3 stooges from working.
 * Fixed glitches in the speech that were caused by not resetting the 
    filter stages when a speech frame is loaded.
 * Made the SP0250 support the external clock rate
 * Changed the playback rate to match the real board by making the clock 
    divider a reasonable number.

Added new debugger command 'map', which tells logical -> physical mappings
as well as what read/write handlers are connected to an address. Also added
'mapd' and 'mapi' for performing the same operation on data and I/O space.
[Aaron Giles]

More Voodoo updates: [Aaron Giles]
 * fixed overflow in 1/W calculation that messed up some textures
 * added missing color combine mode used by Gauntlet Dark Legacy

Fixed subtle bug in the MIPS3 recompiler that prevented Tenth Degree from
working. [Aaron Giles]

Implemented some more functionality of the ADSP-2181 needed for Road Burners.
