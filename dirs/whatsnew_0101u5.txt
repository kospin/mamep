Source Changes
--------------
Added a FIFO for the sound commands in Sega Model 1 driver so they no longer
get lost at startup. Fixed the CPU speed of the 68000. [R. Belmont]

Several fixes and improvements to the C352 sound emulator.
[hoot development team]

Implemented several missing features in the Namco NA sound emulator. [cync]

Added conditional dip switches and a missing dip switch to excelsr.
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed J. League protection workarounds so they work for 2 player games as
well. Also fixed sonic so it works as well as the prototype version (still
major graphics issues). [Anonymous]

Marked several large arrays properly as const. [Atari Ace]

Fixed 6805 core so that CLRA does not modify the carry flag. [Ernesto Corvi]

Fixed sprites wrap around in st0016 (needed in nratechu). 
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Model 3 update: [Ville Linde]
 * Added Daytona USA 2 Power Edition
 * Huge update to the video hardware, including:
    - Transparency support (polygons and textures)
    - Nearly perfect rendering order (something we never got right in 
      Supermodel :-)
    - Parallel lighting
    - Texture coordinate mirroring

Added very experimental rasterizer generator for the Voodoo emulator, which
generates X86 assembly blitters optimized for each case. Unfortunately, it
doesn't help performance much and they are still too buggy so they are
disabled for now. Enable them in the makefile. [Aaron Giles]

Made some of the hack optimizations runtime enableable in the Voodoo
emulator, and added a frameskipper. Use Ctrl+1-6 to control frameskipping,
Ctrl+F/H/Q to run at full/half/quarter resolution. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote most of the validity checks so the full set now completes in well
under 1 second, minus I/O time from paging in data. Also added region
size checking versus memory maps to the validity checks. Moved all validity
checks to a new file validity.c. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the AM_REGION() macro to store region/offset information instead of
a pointer to simplify some of the region valdation code. [Aaron Giles]
