Source Changes
--------------
Fixed a number of games that were broken with the u1 update. Just a few
more cases remain. Most games are working at this point. [Aaron Giles, with
contributions from El Condor, R. Belmont, Ville Linde]

Added preliminary save state support to Missile Command and Battlezone.
[Buddabing]

Fixed some dips in Pop's Pop's. [Sonikos]

Fixed inputs in Woodpecker. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Updated PowerPC core to use new disassembler style. [Nathan Woods]

Merged in recent updates from MESS PC emulation code. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed DTD in the -listxml output. [Oliver Stoneberg] 

Added sprites banking, tile banking, sound banking, and a couple of
DIP switches to Egg Hunt. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Updated 6502 family of disassemblers to the new disassembler style. Added
internal memory maps for the m6510 and m4510 CPU cores. Updated m4510 to
use address translation hooks. [Nathan Woods]

Reduced how often the debugger display is refreshed if stepping and
steps_until_stop is a high number.  This makes commands like 'step 
#10000' a bit more usable. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed MESS UI code that prevented P and Esc from being intercepted properly.
[Lawrence Gold]

Added check and failure for 0-sized mallocs. [Nathan Woods]

Updated i86 and i286 cores to hook into the new i386 disassembler.
[Nathan Woods]

Added MMU support to the MIPS3 dynamic recompiler. Re-enabled it by default.
Added direct fast RAM access to the dynamic recompiler, as well as optional
hotspot optimizations. Most games should show a net speedup over the pre-MMU
compiler. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed FPU decoding and a few other minor issues in the i386 disassembler.
[Aaron Giles]

Added rudimentary hotspot detection to the debugger. Type "help hotspot" for
details on how it works. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up the way the debugger hooks into the memory subsystem. Now, on each
CPU switch, the debugger queries the memory system for callbacks to be called
on every read/write. This allows more efficient watchpoint tracking and allows
for non-watchpoint debugging behaviors like the hotspot detection.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed the way encrypted CPU memory is allocated and managed. Previously,
memory_set_opcode_base() was used to set a single pointer to the decrypted
opcodes; however this presented a number of limitations. Now that all RAM and
ROM-like regions are assigned banks, the memory system now tracks decrypted
opcodes per bank. For implicit banks (marked RAM or ROM in the memory map),
a new function memory_set_decrypted_region() configures which areas of the
address space contain decrypted opcodes and where the decrypted opcodes live.
For explicit banks, there is a new function memory_configure_bank_decrypted()
which operates identically to memory_configure_bank() but specifies a pointer
to the decrypted opcodes on a per-bank basis. Updated all drivers using the
old mechanism to the new mechanism and removed the old system. [Aaron Giles]

Thanks to the new opcode handling, removed "RAMROM" support from the memory
subsystem altogether, and updated all drivers to simply limit their decryption
to areas that the CPU decrypted. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed activecpu_dasm() and cpunum_dasm() to detect the presence of an updated
disassembler and wraps the calls to that rather than crashing. [Aaron Giles]
